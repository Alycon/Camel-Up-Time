 NOTE :: numbers are all moneys
 Rules of Camel cup (very simplified) :
 - game starts with 3 money for everyone
 - ends by camel crossing fin line (CROSSiNG THRough)
 - camels stack, top is first, bottom last
 - win by getting most money at end of game
 - game plays in terms of "legs"
 - legs end when drawn 5 pyramid cards
 - earliest bet for overall Winner / loser gets +8/+5/+3/+2/+1 (if Correct) (if wrong, -1)
 - players have 4 choices ::
      can get a pyramid card ||
      can get leg bet cards (bet on a camel to win, if first; +5/+3/+1; if 2nd; +1/+1/+1; else; -1/-1/-1) ||
      can bet on who will win or lose ENTIRE RACE ||
      can put a desert tile (either +1/-1) cant be on a space w/ camels or next to tile --
      --(if camel steps on, player who put tile get +1) ||
      
 Nuiances of Camel cup (really stupid specific rules) :
 - money automatically gets changed for optimal setting
 - die get revealed AFTER they roll
 - camels get set up at beginning according to random roll
 - cant go below 1 moneys
 - can bet multiple times on winner / loser with remaining cards
 - can change position and orientation of desert tile things
 - earliest bet for overall Winner / loser gets
